## Development of additional schematics

If you would like to create a PR with additional useful schematics these commands may be useful...

### Testing

Use `npm link` in the project directory and `npm link @angular-extensions/schematics` 
in target project which was generated by Angular CLI.

Then you can execute available schematics with 
`ng g <@angular-extensions/schematics:<selected-schematics> --name <path/name>` to try it out.

### Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.
