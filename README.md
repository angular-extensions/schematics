## Getting started
1. enter your project which was generated with Angular CLI.
2. run `npm i -D @angular-extensions/schematics` and `npm i  -S ngx-model`
3. run `ng g model path/my-model --collection @angular-extensions/schematics`
4. or run `ng g model path/my-collection-model --items --collection @angular-extensions/schematics`
5. add your own model service methods and tests

### Testing

To test locally, install `@angular-devkit/schematics` globally and use the `schematics` command line tool. That tool acts the same as the `generate` command of the Angular CLI, but also has a debug mode.

Check the documentation with
```bash
schematics --help
```

or use `npm link` in the project directory and `npm link @angular-extensions/schematics` 
in target project which was generated by Angular CLI.

Then you can execute available schematics with `ng g model path/my-model --collection @angular-extensions/schematics`

### Unit Testing

`npm run test` will run the unit tests, using Jasmine as a runner and test framework.
